Original HEX-Files from DL4JAL
==============================

This folder contains the original HEX-Firmware files for the
PIC 18F452, as provided by Andreas Lindenau (DL4JAL) on his
website `http://www.dl4jal.eu/avfo/avfo.html`.

Folder `impulse_100`
====================

Versions without software-based doubling of the rotary encoder impulses,
so you get 100 impulses per each complete rotation of the encoder:

var11
    Variant for the PIC18F452 in English.

var12
    Variant for the PIC18F452 in German.

var13
    Variant for the PIC18F452 in German. Displays mode "FM" instead of "DIr".

var14
    Variant for the PIC18F452 in German. Like variant 13, but during transmit in modes "CW" and "CWr" it uses the IF of "DIG" and "DIr", respectively.

var31
    Variant for the PIC18F4520 in English.

var32
    Variant for the PIC18F4520 in German.

var33
    Variant for the PIC18F4520 in German. Displays mode "FM" instead of "DIr".

var34
    Variant for the PIC18F4520 in German. Like variant 33, but during transmit in modes "CW" and "CWr" it uses the IF of "DIG" and "DIr", respectively.


Folder `impulse_200`
====================

Versions with 200 impulses per each complete rotation of the encoder:

var1
    Variant for the PIC18F452 in English.

var2
    Variant for the PIC18F452 in German.

var3
    Variant for the PIC18F452 in German. Displays mode "FM" instead of "DIr".

var21
    Variant for the PIC18F4520 in English.

var22
    Variant for the PIC18F4520 in German.
